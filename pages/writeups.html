            <h1>Writeups</h1>
            <p>This is where I store all of my CTF writeups, be they big or small (when I have the time to participate in one).</p>
            <p> I'm really inexperienced, so every CTF challenge is a pretty big learning experience for me. Writing down my thought process helps to cement this and is pretty satisfying in general.</p>
            <p>These writeups are generally for my future reference (although I'm probably better off referring to those done by other, way more talented participants) and serve as a way for me to keep up a bit with HTML and the like. Feel free to read through them if you wish to.</p>
