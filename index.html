        <h1>Welcome to my, as of yet, static website.</h1>
        <p>I'm not exactly sure as to what I plan to do with this website, but hopefully I'll add some more of my writeups, experiences, projects etc. in the future.</p>
        <p>This is all for fun, really, so don't expect any sort of fixed schedule (that is, if anybody other than me visits this site).</p>
        <p>By the way, just a reminder that this site is (permanently):</p>
